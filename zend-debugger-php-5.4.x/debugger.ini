; Specifies the hosts that are allowed to connect (hostmask list) with Zend Debugger when running a remote debug session with Zend Studio
zend_debugger.allow_hosts=127.0.0.1/32,10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12

; Specifies the hosts that are not allowed to connect (hostmask list) with the Zend Debugger when running a remote debug session with Zend Studio
zend_debugger.deny_hosts=

; A list of hosts (hostmask list) that can use the machine on which Zend Server is installed to create a communication tunnel for remote debgging with Zend Studio. This is done to solve firewall connectivity limitations
zend_debugger.allow_tunnel=

; The user ID of the httpd process that runs the Zend Debugger (only for tunneling)
zend_debugger.httpd_uid=-1

; A range of ports that the communication tunnel can use. This defines the minimum value for the range
zend_debugger.tunnel_min_port=1024

; A range of ports that the communication tunnel can use. This defines the maximum value for the range
zend_debugger.tunnel_max_port=65535

; Define which clients know that the Zend Debugger is installed:
; 0 - Never. The presence of the Zend Debugger is not detected by other clients
; 1 - Always. All clients can detect the Zend Debugger
; 2 - Allowed Hosts. Only clients listed in zend_debugger.allow_hosts can detect the Zend Debugger
; Any other value makes the Zend Debugger undetectable (same as "Never")
zend_debugger.expose_remotely=2

; The Debugger's timeout period (in seconds) to wait for a response from the client (Zend Studio) (units: seconds)
zend_debugger.passive_mode_timeout=20

; Enables fast time sampling which is dependent on CPU cycles and frequency, otherwise, the directive uses operating system timing (which may be less accurate)
zend_debugger.use_fast_timestamp=1

; Enable code-coverage feature, should only be true on local debugger
zend_debugger.enable_coverage=0
